                    <h2>Project</h2>
                    <h4>Purpose</h4>
                    <p>
                    Programming is fun. Dungeons and Dragons is fun. Is coding Dungeons and Dragons funâ€¦for sure! In 2014 I was gaming with friends running a game of 4th edition (the most unnecessarily complicated edition) and thought to myself, "Could I make running this experience easier? There is so much to track and I am very much anti-lots of paper." So, I decided to test this question by programming a desktop application to see what I could make easier and then try it out on my friends. Let's just say, there were definitely some mid-game crashes now and again, but generally we liked it (especially the combat tracker displayed on a second screen).

                    <h4>Technology</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Digital Dungeon Master (DDM) desktop application was built using Visual Studio with C#.NET framework and leveraged SQL Express for its database needs. The application was built with a primary window container allowing for multiple non-modal windows to be opened at one time to leverge several functions and reference information at one time.

                    <h4>Learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        Developing the DDM application gave me experience developing a desktop application vs working with the web applications I was use to professionally. It gave me experience using data-bindings for a simple database interface and how to juggle multiple non-modal windows at once including displaying data on a second screen.
